## About

FrameLock is a lightweight autonomous mobile robot designed to act as a smart camera operator and mobile assistant, integrating real-time face tracking, automatic centering, and adaptive motion.  
This project proposes the design of a lightweight autonomous mobile robot that acts as both a smart camera operator and a mobile carrying  
assistant.
It integrates real-time face tracking, automatic centering, and smooth mobility to follow the user without any manual control.
